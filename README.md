# iTunes-RPC
iTunes-Rich Presence that will make your discord status the song playing on iTunes.


# Requirements
Requires a .env file containing your discord application client id and your Supabase keys to get access to your database storage.
This method requires the user to upload album images to their database storage and the application grabs the images based on the title of the albums. Due to file naming convention the album images need to be exactly the same name as the album minus a few special characters as seen in the code.
